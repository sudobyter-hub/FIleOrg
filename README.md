# FIleOrg
### Very simple tool to move files from directories and sub dirctoires to one directory 
# Why this tool ? 
#### I lost files then I recoverd them but they were messy not orginized. therefor I created this tool to orgnize my files. to keep files with different extenstions isolated and delete the unwanted files.
